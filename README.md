### Hi! I'm Davi Giroux 👋
I graduated in Software Development and Analisys (rough translation) in 2015 but have only been working in software development since 2017.

## Some work related things about me 👨🏻‍💻
- I work at [X-Team](https://xteam.com) as a Full Stack Developer in the [Originate](https://originate.com) project.
- Even workibg mostly as a Full Stack Engineer, I'm a more frontend specialized dev (I love my React projects ❤).
- I'm currently learning about nextJs and a little bit of GraphQL and have been enjoying both a lot!
- At this time, I'm using ReactJS as the main framework of my personal projects, but I have some VueJS stuff in there too.
- For the backend I have a bunch of experience with .net, but I tend to use Node as it is easier and quicker to setup.

## Some general things about me 
- 🎸  I have a rock band! You can check us out at [Spotify as To Descent](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kL0OVamLZTRvscqmBuPSC)
- ✈  I'm currently working on a plan to move to Canada in 2023
- 💂‍♂️  Although I lived in London for about a year when I was 7 years old, I actually learned english just by playing video games and watching youtube videos and not by living there.
- ✍🏼  Sometimes I write some stuff but I'm not at all as active as I wanted on [Medium](https://davigiroux.medium.com/).
