# Davi Giroux

Developer from Brazil building things and sharing what I learn along the way.

## What I'm Up To

**[DevGiroux](https://devgiroux.com)** - My tech blog about development, finance, and whatever I'm currently deep-diving into. Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and MDX.

Currently on a two-week sprint to launch, then it's all about creating content and growing an audience.

## Stack

Next.js • TypeScript • Tailwind CSS • MDX • Vercel

Also getting deep into Claude skills and workflow automation - teaching AI to speed up my content creation has been a game changer.

## How I Work

- Ship something that works, improve it based on real feedback
- Build reusable systems so I'm not reinventing the wheel
- Ask the right questions before writing code
- Document the process, including the parts that didn't go smoothly

## The Plan

Content first, audience second, products third. Building the foundation now for what comes next.
