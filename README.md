### Hi! I'm Davi Giroux
I graduated in Software Development and Analisys (rough translation) in 2015 but have only been working in software development since 2017.

## Some work related things about me 👨🏻‍💻
- I work at [Kake](https://kake.com/) as a Senior Software Enfineer.
- Even working mostly as a Full Stack Engineer, I'm a more frontend specialized dev (I love my React projects ❤).
- At this time, I'm using ReactJS as the main framework of my personal projects, but I have some VueJS stuff in there too.
- Using Golang as my go-to backend lang.

## Some general things about me 
- 🎸  I have a rock band! You can check us out at [Spotify as To Descent](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kL0OVamLZTRvscqmBuPSC)
- 💂‍♂️  Although I lived in London for about a year when I was 7 years old, I actually learned english just by playing video games and watching youtube videos and not by living there.
